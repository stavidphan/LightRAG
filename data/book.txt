Description: Florence Dupre Latour raconte comment, de son enfance jusqu'a la fin de son adolescence, elle a torture, mutile, tue les petits animaux de compagnie qui lui passaient entre les mains.

L'auteure est cruelle mais nous renvoie a une verite universelle : un bambin qui joue, c'est aussi un redoutable predateur, un Attila ivre de conquetes et de pouvoir, un savant fou pret a toutes les experiences...

Title: War Stories, Volume 4
Description: Garth Ennis visionary series reaches deep into the recesses of history and finds the most spine chilling tales of conflict and war throughout the modern era. This new volume delivers powerful stories that illustrate the horror and humanity within the violence and misery. In this vital tome are two stories written by Ennis and illustrated by Thomas Aria including: Our Wild Geese Go: "T'was England bade our wild geese go, that small nations would be free..." In the Second World War, any Irishman wanting to fight the Nazis had to join the British army- the Republic of Ireland having declared neutrality when the war began. Now, a small unit of Irish soldiers join the advance into Germany- where the going is rough and the enemy nowhere near surrender. And old tensions remain from Ireland's own struggle for independence, as well as the bloody civil war that followed. The Tokyo Club: How do you join The Tokyo Club? Simple. You climb into your single seat, single engine fighter- loaded with fuel and ammunition- and fly 700 miles across the open Pacific until you reach the mainland of Japan. There you fight off any enemy aircraft attempting to hit the American bombers you're escorting to their targets. Still alive? Now comes the fun part. You fly another 700 miles back home to your airstrip on Iwo Jima, fuel running lower and lower, nothing but ocean for miles around. Any battle damage you've suffered will reduce your chances even further. Make it back and you're in the club. And more good news: you get to do it all again tomorrow. This volume collects War Stories #10 - 15 of the ongoing comic book series."

Title: Keeping the World Strange:  A Planetary Guide
Description: A snowflake that describes the multiverse. A team of archaeologists with a mystery benefactor. A century of pulp heroes, atomic ants, kung-fu ghosts, and ships that sail between universes. Villains who hide these wonders from a world they have sold to an unfathomable alien intelligence. And the man, born with the 20th century, who alone can save the world... and his lost friend.
These are the elements of PLANETARY. In telling its story, creators Warren Ellis and John Cassaday uncovered the secret history of the super-hero genre and helped point towards its future, as well as -- just perhaps -- our own.
KEEPING THE WORLD STRANGE: A PLANETARY GUIDE excavates all of this, as well as future studies, revisionism, decompression, whether the characters are proactive or reactive, and other topics. This book offers an archaeology of the archaeologists, and its essays allow us to see the snowflake-like structure of the series from new angles. PLANETARY lives and grows in these pages.

Title: Moskva
Description: Moskva er en tegnet dokumentarbok fra serieskaperne Oystein Runde (33) og Ida Eva Neverdahl (20).
I mai 2013 var Ida og Oystein offisielle gjester pa Kommissia-festivalen i Moskva (Russlands storste tegneseriefestival) og holdt foredrag og presentasjoner av tegneserieprosjektene sine. Oppholdet skulle vise seg a bli svaert spennende, og de hadde mange interessante, uventede og koole opplevelser (som de selv sier). Proppfulle av inntrykk bestemte de pa hjemveien at de ville lage en tegneseriereiseskildring fra turen.
CoverMoskvaWeb
Et droyt halvar etter er boka Moskva ferdig; et 80-siders verk i farger, om tegnernes eventyr og erfaringer fra et merkelig og fremmed sted. Boka kan best beskrives som morsom, samfunnskritisk, koselig, alvorlig, fabulerende og selvbiografisk. Den er ogsa en beretning om vennskap ... og uventet kjaerlighet ... Oystein og Ida har utfoldet seg som bare de kan. De forteller hver for seg etappevis, noe som gir en variert fremdrift i fortellingen. Vi presenteres for politiske grupper de motte i demonstrasjonstog 1. mai, konsekvensene av Stalins handlinger for lenge siden, og far en forklaring pa hva som kan vaere arsakene til homolovgivningen.
Kombinasjonen Runde og Neverdahl var i utgangspunktet ikke noe mange hadde regnet med: Runde er mest kjent for den intense og realistiske vikingserien om Olav Sleggja og for a vaere mannen bak Norges barskeste superhelt Bjartmann, mens Neverdahl tegner serier om enhjorninger og rode pandaer i bladet Nemi. Derfor er ogsa motet mellom de to en stor del av boken.
Runde har vunnet Kulturdepartementets tegneseriepris 2007 for manuset til De Fire Store: Nar de dode vakner, som er tegnet av Geir Moen. Han er ogsa kjent for samarbeidet med Kristopher Schau om Margarin.
Neverdahl er ogsa Norges mest internasjonalt delte serieskaper - webserien Like an artist er i dag delt langt over en million ganger.
PS Boka inneholder ogsa Putin lettkledd til hest, kjekke kasakhstanere, spooning og ekte kjaerlighet.

Title: Piltrafilla
Description: Jeffrey Brown, aclamado autor conocido por sus obras autobiograficas Torpe e Inversosimil, dirige su atencion en Piltrafilla a la larga senda recorrida hasta convertirse en un artista, desde sus aficion infantil por los comics hasta su paso por la Escuela del Instituto de Arte de Chicago y el consiguiente desencanto con la vision oficial de lo que son las Bellas Artes.
Ademas, nos narra con precision de detalles otros aspectos de su vida intima como la enfermedad de Crohn, el malestar con su propio cuerpo durante la adolescencia, las borracheras con sus amigos en la universidad y los coqueteos con el consumo de drogas, su amistad con grandes autores de comic como Chris Ware o Daniel Clowes y sus primeros pasos como autor, enviando muestras de su obra a editoriales y decidiendose al fin a autopublicarse. Todo ello con el estilo directo, simple y rasgado al que nos tiene acostumbrados.

Title: A Game of Thrones: The Graphic Novel, Vol. 4
Description: Bestselling writer Daniel Abraham and acclaimed illustrator Tommy Patterson bring their stunning graphic-novel adaptation of George R. R. Martin's classic A Game of Thronesto a stunning finish that merits a place alongside the majestic original on the bookshelf of every fantasy fan.
The death of King Robert Baratheon and the imprisonment of his Hand, Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell, has set the great houses of Westeros at one another's throats.
In Winterfell, Eddard's eldest son and heir, Robb Stark, has gathered an army and is pushing south, determined to free his father. Along the way, he pledges to marry the daughter of Lord Walder Frey in exchange for a military advantage that allows him to capture Jaime Lannister--a powerful bargaining chip to ensure Lord Eddard's safe release. But it is one thing to capture the Kingslayer and quite another to hold him.
Meanwhile, in King's Landing, young King Joffrey has other ideas than an exchange of prisoners. Ignoring the advice of his mother, Queen Cersei, he throws oil on the flames of conflict and ignites a conflagration that seems likely to consume not only the Starks but all of Westeros--unless Tyrion Lannister, the Imp, can bring the mad boy-king to heel.
Beyond the Wall, greater dangers are brewing, as a winter as brutal as any in history approaches, bringing with it unnatural creatures out of legend. There, Eddard's bastard, Jon Snow, must decide once and for all where his loyalties lie.
And across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys Targaryen will learn the true measure of grief--and emerge from its fiery depths transformed, hardened, and ready to claim what is hers by right: the Iron Throne.

Title: Complete Cartoons of the New Yorker
Description: The book that Janet Maslin of The New York Timeshas called "indispensable" and "a transfixing study of American mores and manners that happens to incorporate boundless laughs, too" is finally available in paperback--fully updated and featuring a brand new introduction by Adam Gopnik.
Organized by decade, with commentary by some of the magazine's finest writers, this landmark collection showcases the work of the hundreds of talented artists who have contributed cartoons over the course ofThe New Yorker'seight-two-year history. From the early cartoons of Peter Arno, George Price and Charles Addams to the cutting-edge work of Alex Gregory, Matthew Diffee and Bruce Eric Kaplan (with stops along the way for the genius of Charles Barsotti, Roz Chast, Jack Ziegler, George Booth, and many others), the art collected here forms, as David Remnick puts it in his Foreword, "the longest-running popular comic genre in American life."
Throughout the book, brief overviews of each era's predominant themes--from the Depression and nudity to technology and the Internet, highlight various genres of cartoons and shed light on our pastimes and preoccupations. Brief profiles and mini-portfolios spotlight the work of key cartoonists, including Arno, Chast, Ziegler, and others.
The DVD-ROM included with the book is what really makes the "Complete Cartoons" complete. Compatible with most home computers and easily browsable, the disk contains a mind-boggling 70,363 cartoons, indexed in a variety of ways. Perhaps you'd like to find all the cartoons by your favorite artist. Or maybe you'd like to look up the cartoons that ran the week you were born, or all of the cartoons on a particular subject. Of course, you can always begin at the beginning, February 21, 1925, and experience the unprecedented pleasure of reading through every single cartoon ever published in The New Yorker.
Enjoy this one-of-a-kind protrait of American life over the past eight decades, as captured by the talented pens and singular outlooks of the masters of the cartoonist's art.

Title: Batman/Huntress: Cry for Blood
Description: "You want justice served? You want vengeance taken? You want honor restored?
"Then do it yourself.
"That's omerta."
So runs the code that the vigilante known as the Huntress has followed all her life. Now, in the aftermath of Gotham City's "No Man's Land," someone is out for Huntress's blood, and her code of omerta is leading her into destruction.
What fuels this single-minded devotion to vengeance? How did a little girl named Helena Bertinelli grow up to be the Huntress? Finding out may be the only way that a man called the Question can keep her alive.
But even if he can gain her trust, the Question can only push her so far. In the end, only the Huntress can choose which road she will take -- the path of justice, or the path of vengeance.
Batman/Huntress: Cry for Blood collects the acclaimed six-issue miniseries created by Eisner Award-winning writer Greg Rucka (Detective Comics) and Eisner Award-winning artists Rick Burchett (Batman and Robin Adventures) and Terry Beatty (Batman: Gotham Adventures).

Title: Vikramaditya's Throne
Description: This is the story of how the magnificent throne of Raja Vikramaditya was destined to be discovered centuries later by Raja Bhoja. It is said that, due to a curse, thirty-two apsaras were turned into statues that supported the throne. Raja Bhoja was instrumental in releasing them from the curse by patiently listening to each of their stories, thirty-two in all, on the life and adventures of the magnanimous Vikramaditya.
The story of the throne, the thirty-two stories as narrated by the statues, and the twenty-five stories told by Vetala to Vikramaditya on one of his adventures, are all contained in the original Sanskrit work Vikrama Charita, written between the 11th and 13th Centuries. The stories changed as they traveled across several regions of the country and were retold in different languages. Today we find many different versions of the same stories coming from different parts of the country.

Title: Our Sentence is Up: Seeing Grant Morrison's The Invisibles
Description: Grant Morrison's THE INVISIBLES has been hailed as an ambitious comics masterpiece, the key to Morrison's entire body of work, and the inspiration for THE MATRIX. But it's also frequently written off as incomprehensible. Using a conversational, accessible style, Patrick Meaney (director of GRANT MORRISON: TALKING WITH GODS) opens up THE INVISIBLES through in-depth analysis that makes sense of the series's complicated ideas, fractured chronology, and delirious blend of fiction and reality. Meaney also explores how the series's fictional conspiracy theories fare in the wake of 9/11 and the War on Terror. The book includes an extensive interview with Grant Morrison and an introduction by Timothy Callahan (author of GRANT MORRISON: THE EARLY YEARS). From Sequart Research & Literacy Organization.

Title: Introducing Postmodernism
Description: Here is the new expanded edition of the international bestseller Introducing Postmodernism. Has the 21st century resolved the question of postmodernism or are we more than ever ensnared in its perplexities? Postmodernism seemed to promise an end to the grim Cold War era of nuclear confrontation and oppressive ideologies. Fukuyama's notoriously proclaimed end of history, the triumph of liberal democracy over Communist tyranny, has proved an illusion. We awoke in the anxious grip of globalization, unpredictable terrorism and unforeseen war. Introducing Postmodernism traces the pedigrees of postmodernism in art, theory, science and history, providing an urgent guide to the present. Derrida, Baudrillard, Foucault and many other icons of postmodern complexity are brilliantly elucidated by Richard Appignanesi and enlivened by the Guardian's Biff cartoonist Chris Garratt.

Title: Branded (Branded, #1)
Description: An original tale of the old west.
A young cowhand on his way home runs afoul of a pair of ranchers with strange tastes, who live in a county with even stranger, darker ways.
Book 1 of 2. 33 pages. Color and Black and white.
This book follows in the vein of Neko - -so it's not for the faint of heart. Bondage, heavy non-con, fetish and a bit of political incorrectness. (The occasional midget and a bit of beasteality.)
I'll have this book eventually available via Lulu.com, but it will be an edited version without some of the heavier fetish, so as not to offend their standards too terribly.

Title: Hellblazer, Volume 16: The Wild Card
Description: After his epic journey through the American heartland, John Constantine is coming home to England. Believed to be dead, Constantine needs to set the record straight with the last surviving members of his family. Then, in "Red Sepulchre," John has walked into the middle of an ugly range war between rival groups of magicians. Like it or not, he's going to have to choose a side--and it would help if he knew which faction wants him dead. Later, after an ambiguous tip-off from a dead informant, John takes steps to protect himself against a demonic attack. But when the ambush comes from an unexpected direction, his magic defenses fail him, and the only thing he has to fall back on is his knowledge of darkest London.

Title: Can't We Talk about Something More Pleasant?
Description: In her first memoir, Roz Chast brings her signature wit to the topic of aging parents. Spanning the last several years of their lives and told through four-color cartoons, family photos, and documents, and a narrative as rife with laughs as it is with tears, Chast's memoir is both comfort and comic relief for anyone experiencing the life-altering loss of elderly parents.
When it came to her elderly mother and father, Roz held to the practices of denial, avoidance, and distraction. But when Elizabeth Chast climbed a ladder to locate an old souvenir from the "crazy closet"--with predictable results--the tools that had served Roz well through her parents' seventies, eighties, and into their early nineties could no longer be deployed.
While the particulars are Chast-ian in their idiosyncrasies--an anxious father who had relied heavily on his wife for stability as he slipped into dementia and a former assistant principal mother whose overbearing personality had sidelined Roz for decades--the themes are universal: adult children accepting a parental role; aging and unstable parents leaving a family home for an institution; dealing with uncomfortable physical intimacies; managing logistics; and hiring strangers to provide the most personal care.
An amazing portrait of two lives at their end and an only child coping as best she can, Can We Talk about Something More Pleasantwill show the full range of Roz Chast's talent as cartoonist and storyteller.
